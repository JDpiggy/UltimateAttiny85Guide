# Fake Update Prank
### Description:

**made for:**<br>
This was designed for the ATtiny85 for Windows<br>

#### UpdatePrank(code).ino:<br>
This navigates to the specified link and fullscreens it. This effectively puts a borderless windows update(blue) screen on your computer. This can be exited by pressing the windows key, or by HOLDING escape. if you just tap escape nothing will happen. This is perfect for pranks, or convincing someone that you or they can't get their work done on a device. (I don't condone lying, nor is the author of this code liable for your actions, don't make bad choices.) To my knowledge this site should play this forever.<br>

Here is what it looks like(fullscreen screenshot)
