# Attiny85 Awesome Payloads
I spent over 6 hours trying to setup andtroubleshoot my ATtiny85. I don't think anyone should have to go through that, so I am making a full guide to setting up your ATtiny85 so it should take like 10 miniutes.
# Attiny85 Awesome Payloads

I hope you like, and if not tell me what needs fixing.
