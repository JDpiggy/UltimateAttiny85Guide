# Setting up Attiny85
I spent over 6 hours trying to setup and troubleshoot my ATtiny85. I don't think anyone should have to go through that, so I made a [full guide to setting up your ATtiny85](https://github.com/JDpiggy/UltimateAttiny85Guide/blob/main/FULLSETUPGUIDE.md) so it should take like 10 miniutes.
# Attiny85 Awesome Payloads
I've also coded some simple and fun payloads which are shared here!
I hope you like, and if not tell me what needs fixing. It's also worth mentioning that MTK911 made a [much nicer set of payloads](https://github.com/MTK911/Attiny85) if you are interested.
