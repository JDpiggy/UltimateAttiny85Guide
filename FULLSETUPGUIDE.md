# Full Setup guide (for Windows)

## Making sure your computer knows it's plugged in
I know this sounds silly but your computer likely doesn't even recognize the device. A great indication of whether or not your computer going to recognize the ATtiny85 is the USB port that you plug your device into. a blue thingy inside the USB port means USB 3.0, a red one means USB 3.1, and a black one means 2.0 (reference image below). Unfortunately to my knowledge the ATtiny85 is only recognized in a USB 2.0 port. If you don't have a device with USB 2.0, you unfortunatley have to buy a USB 3.0 to 2.0 cable or adapter. However, you might just have a USB to USB cord in your house that works (I didn't but a friend did so that was great). Open the windows menu, then search for device manager

#### PrintOrder(code).ino.:<br>
This navigates to a link  to a document that you specify* then prints, confirms the print, and then Alt + f4's out.<br>

#### *Your  file link:<br>
For the link to be accessed and opened properly you must make sure that the document is shared/accesible to the device you want to send the print order from. This is perfect for taking something from your personal computer and printing on a friend's/coworker's/connected computer.
